# Classifying malignant breast cancer tissues using machine learning

Machine Learning project in the course 81610 - Machine Learning at Universit√° di Bologna.


The goal of this project was to broaden our understanding of techniques and important principles of machine learning. We have implemented our own neural network from scracth in Python, as well as comparing performance and complexity to other well-known methods. 


**NeuralNetowrk.py**
Source code for the implementation of our own neural network in Python.
