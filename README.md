# Classifying malignant breast cancer tissues using machine learning

Machine Learning project in the course 81610 - Machine Learning at Universit√° di Bologna.


The goal of this project was to broaden our understanding of techniques and important principles of machine learning. We have implemented our own neural network from scracth in Python, as well as comparing performance and complexity to other well-known methods. 


_**NeuralNetowrk.py**:_
Source code for the implementation of our own neural network in Python.

_**otherMethods.py**:_
Source code for the implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifers. 

_**Deep_network.ipynb**:_
Source code for the implementation of the deep network.

_**Learning_curve_SNN.py**:_
This code creates figure 4 in the report. Comparison of the learning curves of our own implementation of a shallow network and a corresponding network implementet with Keras.

_**Learning_curves_together.py**:_
This code creates figure 5-8 in the report. The learning curves of the shallow neural network, the deep neural network, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, 


_**Learning_curves.py**:_
This code creates figure 9 in the report. All learning curves compared. 

_**data_breast_cancer.csv**:_
This file contains the data we used. It is a csv file containing the same values as wbcd.data from Wolberg (1992).
